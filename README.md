## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of the project is to show my teachers that i can use and program API rest, data bases and postman. I've tried to show my knowledge in this areas.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The instructions are pretty straight forward:
You just need to hit the " Run in postman" button to deploy either a browser or desktop version of postman with the project's endpoints collection.
In postman, you just have to use those endpoints to make things happen ;)

### Prerequisites

Most of the things that you need to install are nodeJS libraries.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
